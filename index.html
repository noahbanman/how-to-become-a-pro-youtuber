    <h2><a href="#weight-reduction">Weight Reduction</a></h2>
    <p>Reducing the weight of your car is crucial for better performance on the racetrack. Here are some ways to achieve weight reduction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove unnecessary interior components like rear seats, carpets, and sound deadening materials.</li>
      <li>Replace heavy stock parts with lightweight alternatives, such as carbon fiber body panels.</li>
      <li>Use lightweight racing seats and harnesses instead of heavy stock seats.</li>
      <li>Consider using lighter wheels and tires.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="#power-modifications">Power Modifications</a></h2>
    <p>Increasing the power of your car can significantly improve its racing performance. Here are some power modification options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a performance intake and exhaust system for improved airflow.</li>
      <li>Upgrade the engine with high-performance components like camshafts, pistons, and headers.</li>
      <li>Consider adding forced induction systems like turbochargers or superchargers.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="#safety">Safety</a></h2>
    <p>Safety should always be a top priority when turning a car into a race car. Here are some safety measures to consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a roll cage to provide structural rigidity and protect the occupants in case of a rollover.</li>
      <li>Invest in a fire suppression system.</li>
      <li>Upgrade the stock seatbelts to racing harnesses for better restraint during high-speed maneuvers.</li>
      <li>Consider adding a racing seat with appropriate side bolstering for improved support.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="#upgraded-brakes">Upgraded Brakes</a></h2>
    <p>Enhancing the braking capabilities of your car is crucial for better control and stopping power. Here's what you can do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upgrade the brake pads and rotors to high-performance options.</li>
      <li>Consider installing a big brake kit for improved heat dissipation and braking performance.</li>
      <li>Upgrade the brake lines to stainless steel for better pedal feel and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="#aerodynamic-modifications">Aerodynamic Modifications for Downforce</a></h2>
    <p>Aerodynamics play a vital role in race car performance, especially in generating downforce. Consider the following aerodynamic modifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a front splitter to direct airflow and reduce lift.</li>
      <li>Install a rear wing or spoiler to generate downforce and improve stability.</li>
      <li>Consider adding diffusers to manage airflow underneath the car.</li>
      <li>Ensure the body panels are properly aligned and sealed to minimize drag.</li>
    </ul>
